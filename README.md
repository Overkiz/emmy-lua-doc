# emmy-lua-doc

This repo is intended for developers using IntelliJ with the [EmmyLua plugin](https://github.com/EmmyLua/IntelliJ-EmmyLua) or preferably, now, [IntelliJ-Luanalysis](https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/IntelliJ-Luanalysis/).

It makes linting and static analysis much better for libraries by providing annotated stubs.
